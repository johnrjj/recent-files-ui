# 'Recent files UI' - Dribbble UI Challenge

**[[Demo](https://recent-files-ui.surge.sh)]**

## Overview

Every month I select a Dribbble that looks like it would be fun to build, and challenge myself to build it the fastest I can (going for speed) using only React components. This one took ~8 hours. I'll be doing a write up about it, so stay tuned.

This month the Dribble is a great Dribbble called 'Recent files concept page', [found here](https://dribbble.com/shots/4255897-Recent-files-page-concept). Screenshot below:
