# Recent Files UI - Dribbble UI Challenge

**[[Demo](https://recent-files-ui.surge.sh)]**

## Overview

Every month I select a Dribbble that looks like it would be fun to build, and challenge myself to build it the fastest I can (going for speed) using only React components. This one took ~8 hours. I'll be doing a write up about it, so stay tuned. 

### This Month's Challenge

This month the Dribble is a great Dribbble called 'Recent files concept page', [found here](https://dribbble.com/shots/4255897-Recent-files-page-concept). Screenshot below:

I really like the use of whitespace, subtle shadows, and gray tones, with some distinctive accent colors. This will also provide a great opportunity to show off masonry in the new CSS grid.

### Why

These challenges help achieve the following:

1. Practice CSS with complex website layouts
2. Practice component design decomposition and component building composition
2. Be constantly exposed to latest design trends and subsequently, their CSS implementations

### Rules

- Get as close to the screenshot mockup as possible
- Chrome compat only
- No adaptive design / mobile considerations

## Tech

* React
* styled-components
* Flow
* [Feathers icons](https://feathericons.com/)

That's really it! Our React stack is super lightweight and prototype-friendly.
